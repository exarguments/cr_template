CR Investments is a stock advisory company that specializes in providing fundamentally well researched stock investment ideas
 for you to invest in for the long term.
We believe in a Value+Growth approach while investing in companies.
We believe that "wealth generation" cannot happen through short term trading and
hence our philosophy is based on investing money in premiere companies using our "investment tenets" and for the long term.
Our investment tenets are heavily influenced by famous investors Peter Lynch & Warren Buffet who have been very successful using their
unique approach to investing.

We understand the efforts you take to earn and manage your wealth.
Thus CR Investments acts as a partner and we take complete care to ensure that we not only suggest stock ideas but
 we also regularly monitor the performance of stocks and suggest timely measures like when to buy more shares,
 what is the right time to sell the stock and we also suggest the duration you should hold stocks so as to gain maximum benefit.

                    Before I joined CR Investments I would have rated myself closer to an expert in trading. However, I quickly learned that I was probably closer to a novice as I was exposed to a completely different way of trading. CR Investment's approach is all about
                    statistical analysis and creating an actual trading plan Instead of the "buy & sell short term trading" I was doing. My risk has been cut significantly and my profits have been steadier. I can now see that before I was simply gambling.</p>

                    I can't say enough about CR Investments, I signed up with their wealth management program and I have gained significantly over the last 1 year. I was suffering losses through my previous investments but Chaitanya, the advisor at CR, turned things around
                    for me. I can now go on the holiday I always dreamt of knowing my investments are in good hands! .....

                subscribing with us for a longer period means

        <h1>Stock Advisory Services</h1>
        <p>The stock market has created incredible wealth for millions of people and is undoubtedly one of the most highly rewarding sources of wealth generation. However, investing in stocks needs to be done intelligently. Historically, staying invested in the right stock for the long term has been known to result in the best gains.</p>
        <p>Successful investing in equity markets requires adequate research in identifying and evaluating stocks for investment. The investment portfolio has to be diversified to manage risks, and it needs to be periodically reviewed and rebalanced to reflect the performance of sectors and companies.</p>
        <p>Stock investment is by no means a get rich quick scheme. Making money in equities is not as easy as it looks. It requires oodles of patience and discipline with a great deal of research and a comprehensive understanding of how the market functions. Proven stock selection techniques will make sure you are on your way to financial success.</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>CR Investments' stock selection is based on a strict regimen of:
        <ul>
          <li>Past performance & company statistics</li>
          <li>Company debt</li>
          <li>Expected growth of the company & industry</li>
          <li>Expected return on equity</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
        <p>It is important to ensure that investment decisions are based on qualitative and quantitative research. Equity investing and advisory require an adequate investment horizon for the rationale to play out and also to manage short-term volatility in prices.</p>
        <p>CR Investments helps you manage your investments in the stock markets by giving you complete advice regarding stock selection, holding time and exit price. Our timely monitoring ensures you are always up to date with the right information and on track to earn maximum returns from your stock portfolio!</p>

          <h1>Mutual Fund Advisory</h1>
          <p>A mutual fund is essentially a collection of different investments. Mutual fund can be stock or equity funds, bond funds, balanced funds (a combination of stock and bond funds), lifestyle fund or money market fund.</p>
          <p>The money you invest in a mutual fund is pooled along with that of other shareholders with similar financial goals. Most mutual funds are part of a larger investment company or family of funds. Each fund is managed by a team of professional money managers who monitor the fund's performance and, based on thorough research, choose investments they believe will help the fund reach the investment objectives.</p>
          <p>CR Investments recommends mutual funds that are diversified thereby reducing the investment risk. We help you choose the right mutual fund schemes that best suit your requirements. We also advise you on redemptions, switch of units according to variable market conditions.</p>

          <p>CR Investments believes that a disciplined research process is the foundation of superior investment performance. </p>
